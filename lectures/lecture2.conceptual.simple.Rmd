# What is a model


* understanding

* prediction

* communication

You are doing this all the time - there are many reasons to make this process explicit (computer aided modeling)

#  STEPS: Modeling for Problem Solving in ES 

Clearly define your goal (a question you want to answer, hypothesis you want to test, prediction you want to make) - as precisely as possible

* Design or Select your model

* Implement the model

* Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty

* Apply the model to the goal

* Communicate model results

---

#  Designing/Selecting Models 

* What are your inputs-outputs?

* What’s in the box (the model itself) that gives you a relationship between outputs and inputs? 



```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/model_basic.001.jpeg")
```
---

#  Basic components of models 


Inputs: Varying; think x of a x vs y regression

Parameters: single values that influence relationships in the model

Transfer Function (model): Equations that transfer inputs to outputs given parameters

Outputs: what you want to estimate

---

# What's in the box

  * What are the processes/relationships that you think are important to translate inputs to output

  * Transfer function (mathematical representation)

  * Parameters, values that influences how the model relationships work

  * There are often multiple "boxes" internal to a model

#  What’s in the box 

Often more complicated than a simple regression…

So we need to think through what the relationships are; the processes are that we want to take in to account

Conceptual models are a good place to start

---

#  Conceptual models of the hydrologic cycle 

Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage

P = ET + ΔS

(at global scales ΔS includes streamflow since that water is still “stored” in the earth

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image6.png")
```

---

# Conceptual Hydrology Model - more complex, multiple boxes 

Goal - estimate streamflow fromm multiple source (surface and subsurface)



```{r, out.width = "25%",out.height="25%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image7.png")
```

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image8.png")
```

#  SERI-Fire 

* More complex model couple sub-models

* How do ecological and human factors interact to influence fire regimes 



```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}

# Model can also be about classification

# Types of Model

There are many different ways to classify models

A *useful* classification looks at how models deal with space, time, and process 

Useful because the *type* of model will have implications for how you *build* and *use/run* the model

#  Stochastic - Deterministic 

Stochastic:  Model output is the probability of flood events of a magnitude greater than 500 m3/sec given rainfall probability distribution (artificial or generated from data) for a 100km2 watershed
Deterministic: Model output is the depth of flood given a rainfall event of 10cm over a 100km2 watershed

#  Lumped …Spatially distributed 

Lumped - single point in space, or space doesn’t matter

Spatially distributed - model is applied to different “patches” in space
spatial units are independent

spatial units interact with each other

#  Static- Dynamic Time Varying 

Static - Processes or Variables modeled do not evolve with time

Dynamic - model elements evolve through time - and variables/results at one time step typically depends on previous time step

#  Abstract - Physically/Process based 

Abstract - relationship between inputs and output depends on parameters that don’t necessarily have a physical meaning

Physically based - parameters do have a physical meaning (could be measured) - relationships derived from first principles (theory) of how things work

#  Conceptual models: Composing 

Pictorial representation of how you think about your system, and what needs to be included in 
the model to answer your questions (or achieve your modelling goal)

There are many software tools available for generating conceptual models, I like

# Conceptual model design

Some model designers uses standard symbols for the different model components

#  Assignment 1 

For assignment one you will create a conceptual model to be presented in class. You will work in groups of 3-4.

1. Identify an environmental problem that would benefit from a model. 

2. Summarize the goal of the model in a few sentences. 

3. Design a conceptual model, consider -  inputs, outputs, important processes/mechanisms/interactions, reservoirs/stores, other intermediate variables or steps, relationships between variables. Put your conceptual model on a single slide and be prepared to present the key inputs and outputs of the model, and the purpose of the model in class

Also add the slide and paragraph on Gauchospace - as Group Assignment
You will need to complete the Group Select task first

Due end of the day on Monday
