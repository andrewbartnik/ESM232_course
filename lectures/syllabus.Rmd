# Course description

<p style="color: #ba5e00"><b> Environmental Modelling: An overview.</p></b>

Models give us a way to look at the world through a mixture of data and theory. A good model can help us to understand how the world works and how decisions that we make might change the world in ways that are important to us. 


# Style

Class will include a mix of lectures and in class hands-on examples, using studentsâ€™ own computers.

I will often provide an R-markdown document for you to go through prior to class so you can learn at your own pace and we will then use class time for the hands-on examples and assignments.

```


# Learning objectives

 - Gain familiarity with different types of models and the situations where you might use them
 
 - Understand how to choose the 'right model' for the job
 
 - Know how to build simple models including
      - input-output models
      - basic dynamic models 
      - matrix models
      
  - Gain some basic skills that are useful in applying models including
      - parameter sensitivity analysis
      - uncertainty analysis
      - model calibration and evaluation
      


# Computing

-   I will assume that everyone has some basic R skills (from ESM 203, ESM 232, MEDS program courses or other courses), including how to use ggplot, and Rmarkdown and build simple functions, as well as a basic understanding if *git* and *Github*

-   Many classes will be working classes so bring these to class

# Assignments


* There are 8 assignments. 

* Some assignments will be done in groups. Assignments will vary in length but most will be short coding assignments with a 1- paragraph write up. 

* Assignments can be submitted as a link to your *GitHub* repository that has assignment files  - the link will be submitted on *Canvas* - that way we can keep track of grading for each assignment. If you find *GitHub* too challenging then you can also submit files directly (if you do this, please make sure you zip multiple files together)

* I will provide a grading rubric for each assignment - but you will get an "A" if you complete the work

# Protocols and Guidance 

*  Learning to program is hard and I may not always explain in a way that is accessible to you - So if you don't understand something *ASK* 

    * ideally ask in class - you will help me to learn how to explain (or find an answer if I don't know it) and you will help others 
    * if you don't feel comfortable asking , reach out to me or Rachel

* Environmental modeling and the coding involved gets better with practice and play - Don't just read the Rmarkdown - try the code, try variations on the ideas presented, make up stuff to try, get your feet wet 

* Programming means making mistakes, expect it, stay calm and try again - if you get frustrated step away and come back; be creative


# **Respect and Support each other** 

  * when working in groups, pay attention to your partner, if they are not at your skill level, help them learn - recognize that we all have different backgrounds
  
  * listen - different perspectives contribute to modeling - ask questions; figure out how different people *see* the world (what is there conceptual model) - I'll try to do this too
  
  * you learn by helping others - do that!
  
  

* If you are really struggling, reach out to Rachel or myself, we can help
(or if you just want to chat about something )
