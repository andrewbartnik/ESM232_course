#  Design/Selecting Models 

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/model_basic.001.jpeg")
```

* What are your inputs-outputs

* What’s in the box (the model itself) that gives you a relationship between outputs and inputs

* Transfer function

* Parameters, values that influences how the model relationships work

#  Types of Models

Conceptual.............Mathematical

Stochastic.............Deterministic

Lumped.............Spatially Distributed: *SPACE*

Static.............Dynamic  : *TIME*

Abstract.............Physically/Process Based

but biggest differences may often be the degree specific processes/parameters are accounted for

#  Types of models: Example 

* Input: Reservoir height (height) and flow rate (flow)
* Output: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

* Parameter: Reservoir Efficiency (K)

Conceptual model

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture3_conceptualmodels2/assets/img/reservoir_cm.001.jpeg")
```

#  Types of models: Example 

* **Input**: Reservoir height and flow rate

* **Output**: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

* **Parameters**: K Efficiency , ρ (density of water), g (acceleration due to gravity)

P = ρ * h * r * g * K Efficiency;

P is Power in watts, ρ is the density of water (~1000 kg/m3), h is height in meters, r is flow rate in cubic meters per second, g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s2, K Efficiency is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1.

This is a static (one point in time), deterministic, lumped (one place) model; its more or less physically based

#  Types of models: Example 

If we expand the model to compute power production over a year, where inputs were streamflow into the reservoir - *Dynamic Model*

If we expand to model power production from all the reservoirs in California, accounting for spatial patterns of snowmelt inputs and upstream-downstream relationships - *Spatially Distributed Model*

If we modified the model to estimate the probability distribution of power production, given a probability distribution of reservoir levels  - *Stochastic Model*

#  STEPS: Modeling for Problem Solving in  ES 

* Clearly define your goal (question you want to answer, hypothesis you want to test, prediction you want to make) - as precisely as possible

* Develop a conceptual model - draw it!

* <span style="color: red;">Design</span> or Select your model

* <span style="color: red;">Implement the model</span>

* Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty

* Apply the model to the goal

* Communicate model results

---
#  Steps for Design and Implement your model 

* Design conceptual model

* Translate conceptual model into a mathematical representation

* Choose programming language

* Define inputs (data type, units)

* Define output (data type, units)

* Define model structure

* Write model

* Document the model  (meta data)

* Test model


#  Assignment 2

Work in group of 2-3 to develop a conceptual model of tree crop yield  - the goal will be able to predict how crop yields might change if seasonal precipitation or air temperature patterns change in California

The Lobell et al. 2006 paper will be the source for your model; specifically look at the equation in table 2.

* List what the inputs and outputs will be - think carefully about time scale and units for inputs and output

* Draw a conceptual model to represent your model that will translate inputs to output, on your diagram list what your inputs and outputs are with units
