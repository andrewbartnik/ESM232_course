#  Mathematical Representation of this model 

Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage

P = ET + ΔS

(at global scales ΔS includes streamflow since that water is still “stored” in the earth)

Water balance can tell you a lot

#  Models for understanding(big #’s, little #’s as controls on phenomena) 

Questions

In a particular place (Baltimore Harbor), would temperature often be a limiting factor in eutrophication?
At what times of year, would N-export matter more or less?

# Modeling for Problem Solving in Environmental Science

* There is something you need to know in order to solve the problem

  * Answer to a question
  
      * What if?
      * How Much?
      * Which Alternative?
      * Why is this happening?
      
  * Test a Hypothesis

# Modeling for Problem Solving in Environmental Science

* Always start by clearly defining your goal as a questions (or hypothesis to be tested)

* Examples?

---

#  Models can also be for communication Example:Glaciers 

Goal: Help public understand why, even if temperature warms - glaciers might grow (due to increasing snowfall) - but a threshold temperature might be reached where glacier will shrink

[Glacier model](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/glaciers/latest/glaciers.html?simulation=glaciers)

#  Model Goals 

*Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)

*Estimation/Scenario* (what might be the consequences of decisions we make about the environment)

*Communication* - contribute to education and broader understanding

---

#  Basic components of models 

**Inputs** : Varying; think *x* of a *x* vs. *y* regression

**Parameters** : single values that influence relationships in the model

**Outputs** : what you want to estimate

---

#  Simple model 

**Input** : Change in unemployment rate

**Output** : Change in GDP

**Parameters** : Slope and intercept of the line

The US "changes in unemployment – GDP growth" regression with the 95% confidence bands.

#  STEPS: Modeling for Problem Solving in  ES 

Clearly define your goal (a question you want to answer, hypothesis you want to test, prediction you want to make) - as precisely as possible

* Design or Select your model

* Implement the model

* Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty

* Apply the model to the goal

* Communicate model results

---

#  Goals 

The goal will help you to define the core pieces of a model

Often helpful to start at the end: Outputs


Problem: which piece of land should be purchased to maximize biodiversity?

Outputs:
monetary costs and benefits of different options in 2015 dollars, including “non-market” benefits

---

# Goals 

The goal will help you to define the core pieces of a model

Often helpful to start at the end: Outputs

Problem: how will forest carbon sequestration change if fire frequency increases with warming

Outputs
carbon sequestration for different fire frequencies

---

# Exercise 

In groups, brainstorm about models that you are familiar with (or could imagine!); provide an example of

a model for estimation

a model for communication

a model for understanding

For each one -
Briefly describe a goal for the model - be as specific as you can

Add your description to the gauchospace forum 
*Examples of Models for Estimation, Communication or Understanding*


# Pre-Class Assignment

* Fill out *Help us get to know you* survey on *Canva*

* Listen to *only* timestap 26:27 to 31:22  (basically 5 minutes) of the following 
blog by Lisa Felman Barrett - a highly cited psychologist

* [blog  26:27 to 31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbdRIVCBqNI)

if you are interested you can learn
[More about Lisa Felman Barrett](https://www.affective-science.org/lisa-feldman-barrett.shtml)

Think about what an inverse inference problem might be in the context of the environment

* Listen to this podcast on climate models - Pay particular to how Gavin Schmidt talks about the design, goal and **skill** of models

[The emergent pattersn of climate change](https://www.ted.com/talks/gavin_schmidt_the_emergent_patterns_of_climate_change?language=en)


If you are interested you can learn
[More about Gavid Schmidt](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/gschmidt/)



After listening to these podcast, do the following

1. Think of a conceptual model that you or someone else might use to understand some pattern that they observe in the environment (in other words a model that might help them to solve an inverse inference problem to understand the mechanisms that causes the observation)?

2. Draw a figure that represents the model - add as much detail as you can about what  inputs, mechanisms and outputs of the model (outputs would likely be the observation, inputs would be something about the environment and mechanisms could be the "how" that changes the inputs (causes) into output (observations))

3. Submit you figure on Canva (Assignment 1) along with 2-3 sentences that describe how this model might be used to understand some observation (or pattern of observations) in the environment 

A few notes:

You can make this as simple or challenging as you like. 

If you don't quite 'get it', don't worry - there isn't a 'right' answer here. Be creative and come up with your best interpretation

4. In this course, we will work a lot with writing and applying functions; You've all been exposed to writing functions in previous courses - but just to make sure that everyone remembers the basic syntax in R, complete the following:

Write a function that computes energy produced from a photovoltaic system if you know the average annual solar radiation.  You can use the following formula

E = A * r * H * PR

* *E* is energy (kWh),
* *A* is the solar panel area (m2)
* *r* is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually around 0.2),
* *PR* is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75) 
* *H* is annual average solar radiation (kWh)

Write your function in R; make sure that you add documentation; include default values for *r* and *PR* in the function definition; save the function in a single file to upload to Canva.

To summarize, submit the following by April 14th

* your conceptual model figure 
* 2-3 sentences describing how it might be used
* a single R file that implements the solar energy yield function
