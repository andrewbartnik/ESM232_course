# Assignment 3
In your same groups - 

+ Develop a profit model for your almond yield (you can make this up - think about what the parameters would be) 
  * you might assume a baseline profit and then adjust according to the anomaly

  * there are many ways to combine the almond yield and profit functions; you can have the profit function "call"/use the almond yield function; or create a wrapper function that calls them in sequence (first the almond yield and then the profit function)

+ Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters

+ Create a single graph of the results - you can decide what is the most meaningful graph 


Submit as a group: an Rmarkdown document, your R files for almond yield and profit model, and Graph on Canvas-
